# Identify-Dog-Breeds-with-Pre-Trained-Image-Classifier
Identify Dog Breeds with Pre-trained Image Classifier
Objectives:
1. Accurately discern which images depict dogs (regardless of breed misclassification) and which do not.
2. Classify the dog breed in the images of dogs.
3. Evaluate which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) best accomplishes objectives 1 and 2.
4. Assess the time resources required to effectively achieve objectives 1 and 2 and determine whether an alternative solution could yield a satisfactory result within the given time frame for each algorithm.
